# Gesture_Volume_Control
This is a Python Project on Computer Vision.
Using the mediapipe and opencv library extensively, this project has been designed so that on bringing the thumb and the index finger closer, volume decreases and volume increases on pulling the fingers away.
The folder consists of 2 files:
  1. handTrackingModule.py - It consists of a class and some objects within whose sole purpose is to track the hand movement and return the position of the finger landmarks
  2. VolumeControl.py - It consistes of the main function. You will the working by seeing the well commented codes itself.
Feel free to make any changes and develop this project.
