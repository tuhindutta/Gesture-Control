# Gesture_Control
This is a Python Project on Computer Vision.
Using the mediapipe and opencv library extensively, this project has been designed so that on bringing the thumb and the index finger closer, volume decreases and volume increases on pulling the fingers away. Likewise, it contains some other projects as well for gesture controls.
The folder consists of 2 files:
  1. handTrackingModule.py - It consists of a class and some objects within whose sole purpose is to track the hand movement and return the position of the finger landmarks
  2. VolumeControl.py - It consistes of the main function. You will understand the working by seeing the well commented codes itself.
  3. BrightnessControl.py - Similarly, this file uses a different python library (screen-brightness-control) to control device brightness.
  4. Gesture_Mouse.py - In this, wxWidgets and pyautogui libraries are used for gesture controlled mouse. You can find the details of working by viewing the well commented code itself.
