# Gesture_Control
This is a Python Project on Computer Vision.
Using the mediapipe and opencv library extensively. It contains multiple projects for gesture controls.
The folder consists of 2 files:
  1. handTrackingModule.py - It consists of a class and some objects within whose sole purpose is to track the hand movement and return the position of the finger landmarks
  2. VolumeControl.py - It consistes of the main function. You will understand the working by seeing the well commented codes itself. This project has been designed so that on bringing the thumb and the index finger closer, volume decreases and volume increases on pulling the fingers away.
  3. BrightnessControl.py - Similarly, this file uses a different python library (screen-brightness-control) to control device brightness with the same previous gesture.
  4. Gesture_Mouse.py - In this, wxWidgets and pyautogui libraries are used for gesture controlled mouse. You can find the details of working by viewing the well commented code itself. It works by tracking the tip of index finger to move the mouse pointer and the left click is enabled by bringing the index and the middle finger close.
